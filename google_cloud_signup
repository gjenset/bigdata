# Google cloud signup

For the practical parts of the session on democratizing data science, we will use big data sitting in the Google cloud BigQuery system. The data is free to use but you need to sign up for a Google Cloud account. In order to sign up you’ll need:

* A Google account
* Your telephone (for authentication)

# Sign-up steps:

You can sign up for a Google Cloud account here: https://console.cloud.google.com/.

Click on “create account” (see lower part of the screen) and select “For my personal use” and “Next”

The next sign-up screen will ask for:

* Your name (first and last)
* Email (use your existing email or click the link under the text box to create a new Gmail account)
* A password (that you choose)

Click “Next”

You will then be asked to verify your phone number. Please have your phone ready when doing this, and follow the instructions on the screen.

Once your phone number has been verified, you will be asked for your date of birth and gender.

Click “Next”

When asked about “Get more from your number”, review the terms and click "Yes, I'm in" to continue.

On the screen called “Privacy and terms”, review the terms and scroll to the bottom.
Click “I agree”

You'll now be redirected to the Google Cloud console. Check the box to agree to terms and click "AGREE AND CONTINUE."

Great job! You’ve now signed up for your Google Cloud account!
